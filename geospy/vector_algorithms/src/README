vector_algorithms.py

   This is a program that given a list of nodes and a list of coordinates builds polygons and calculates areas, side function of a point, line intesections and point in polygon.
The main function plots the polygons defined in the files coords.txt and polygon_oriented.txt. The program is interactive, whenever the user press a polygon the point in polygon function is executed for every polygon to determine in which polygon the point is.

Dependencies:
 Python 2.6.
 Matplotlib
 Random 

Inner dependencies:
 Uses the Node class definition inside dijisktra module (included).

Based on the lecture of Lars Harrie and the book: GIS a computing perspective (Worboys, 2004).

USAGE: python vector_algorithms.py
